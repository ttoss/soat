# SOAT Brand System

**Version 1.1**

---

## 1. Overview

SOAT is an open-source framework for persistent memory in autonomous AI agents. It stores and retrieves context using semantic search over vector embeddings—so an agent can recall the right memory at the right moment.

This brand system translates that capability into a clear identity: the **Semantic Cosmos**—a vast, interconnected field of knowledge where relevance becomes visible.

---

## 2. Brand Philosophy

SOAT’s identity is grounded in how high-dimensional embeddings behave: meaning forms structure in the void.

- **Metaphor:** Memory is not a cabinet—it’s a galaxy. Each fact is a star (a node). Similar ideas cluster by gravity (semantic similarity), forming constellations of intelligence.
- **Promise:** In a chaotic universe of unstructured data, SOAT instantly illuminates the center of relevance.
- **Keywords:** Cosmic, Hyper-connected, Intelligent, Persistent, Luminous.

## 3. Logo: The Vector Galaxy

The primary mark is the **Vector Galaxy**: a swirling nebula of nodes and connective paths.

> **[Insert Image: the swirling galaxy of cyan and purple nodes here]**

### Concept

- **Spiral motion:** continuous ingestion, growth, and evolution.
- **Nodes & links:** embeddings plus semantic relationships.
- **Bright core:** the recall event—SOAT pinpointing what matters.

### Usage

- **Dark-mode first:** The logo is engineered for deep backgrounds; use deep black / very dark navy for maximum glow.
- **Clear space:** Give it room—avoid crowding with text or UI controls.
- **Don’ts:**
  - Don’t invert colors (e.g., dark purple on white).
  - Don’t stretch or distort the spiral.
  - Don’t add drop shadows; the mark already emits its own light.

## 4. Color Palette

SOAT’s palette comes directly from the Vector Galaxy: high-contrast, digital, and luminous.

### Dual-Theme Strategy

SOAT is **dual-theme by design**. We don’t “invert”—we shift the functional primary hue to keep contrast high and the UI accessible in both modes.

### Core Brand Colors (The DNA)

These exist across light and dark themes, primarily in logos and brand imagery.

| Color | Hex Code  | Name            | Role                                                                      |
| ----- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       | `#8E44AD` | **Deep Violet** | Complexity and depth. Secondary accents and gradients.                    |
|       | `#00E5FF` | **Core Cyan**   | The glow. Decorative highlights, data nodes, and dark-mode active states. |

---

### Light Mode Palette (Accessibility First)

Light mode prioritizes legibility on white surfaces. Functional UI uses **Electric Blue**, not neon Cyan.

#### Primary UI Colors

| Color | Hex Code      | Name                | Purpose                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       | **`#1A73E8`** | **Electric Blue**   | Primary light theme color for buttons, links, and key interactive elements. |
|       | **`#1A1F2C`** | **Deep Space Grey** | Primary text color (high contrast without pure black harshness).            |

#### Surface & Background

| Color | Hex Code  | Name            | Purpose                                            |
| ----- | --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|       | `#FFFFFF` | **Pure White**  | Main page background.                              |
|       | `#F5F7FA` | **Pale Cosmos** | Secondary surfaces (cards, sidebars, code blocks). |

---

### Dark Mode Palette (Glow & Contrast)

Dark mode is the native environment: deep surfaces, luminous accents, and high-transparency layers.

#### Primary UI Colors

| Color | Hex Code      | Name                | Purpose                                                               |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       | **`#00E5FF`** | **Core Cyan**       | Primary dark theme color for glowing accents, status, and highlights. |
|       | **`#F0F8FF`** | **Starlight White** | Primary text color on dark backgrounds.                               |

#### Surface & Background

| Color | Hex Code  | Name            | Purpose                                        |
| ----- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
|       | `#080C14` | **Space Black** | Main page background.                          |
|       | `#161B22` | **Nebula Navy** | Secondary surfaces and code block backgrounds. |

### Usage & Accessibility

#### The 4.5:1 Rule

In light mode, **Core Cyan (`#00E5FF`) is never functional text** and should not be used as a background for white text. Treat it as decorative glow only. Use **Electric Blue (`#1A73E8`)** for interactive UI (buttons, links, form fields).

#### Visual Effects (The Futuristic Edge)

- **Glassmorphism:** Use high blur (`backdrop-filter: blur(16px)`) with low opacity backgrounds to create depth and a heads-up-display (HUD) feel.
- **Neon Glows:** Active elements in dark mode should emit light (`box-shadow` and `text-shadow`) using Core Cyan.
- **Deep Space Gradients:** Backgrounds should not be flat black; use subtle radial gradients to imply cosmic depth.

#### Gradients (Vector Galaxy Flow)

- **Light theme:** **Deep Violet (`#8E44AD`) → Electric Blue (`#1A73E8`)**
- **Dark theme:** **Deep Violet (`#8E44AD`) → Core Cyan (`#00E5FF`)**

> **Imagery note:** In light mode, prefer transparent/faded cosmic imagery so it feels embedded in the white interface rather than pasted on top.

## 5. Typography

Typography should feel expansive, futuristic, and intelligent—fitting for a galactic scale.

### Primary Typeface (Headings): Space Grotesk

A contemporary, technical grotesk that feels modern and “engineered” without leaning into sci-fi styling. It supports the Semantic Cosmos aesthetic while staying serious and readable across documentation and UI.

- **Weights:** 700 (Bold) for H1/H2, 600 (Semibold) for H3.
- **Example:** **SOAT: Persistent Memory for AI Agents.**

### Secondary Typeface (Body): Inter

A highly legible UI typeface designed for long-form reading and product interfaces. Inter keeps the tone crisp and systems-oriented across docs, tables, and dense UI.

- **Weights:** 400 (Regular) for body, 500 (Medium) for UI labels.
- **Example:** SOAT stores, retrieves, and manages context through low-latency semantic recall.

---

## 6. Visual Language & Imagery

All supporting visuals should reinforce the Semantic Cosmos.

- **Use:**
  - **Nodes + connections:** constellations of points connected by fine, glowing lines.
  - **Light trails:** motion that suggests data flow and retrieval.
  - **Dark, clean space:** minimal noise; let glow and structure speak.
  - **Abstract geometry:** hexagons, spheres, spirals—formed by light.
- **Avoid:**
  - literal brain icons (generic)
  - classic database cylinders (dated)
  - bright, sunny stock photography (off-theme)

---

## 7. Tone of Voice

Write like a systems engineer describing something powerful.

- **Technical, not academic:** clear explanations; no unnecessary jargon.
- **Confident, not loud:** state benefits plainly.
- **Forward-looking:** emphasize autonomy, memory, and context.
- **Concise:** respect developer attention.

**Examples**

- **Do:** “SOAT provides low-latency semantic recall using vector embeddings.”
- **Don’t:** “We use super-cool futuristic tech so your bot remembers stuff.”
